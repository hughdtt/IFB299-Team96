install MySql server & workbench
when asked for password use "MyNewPass"
if already set up you'll have to reset your password to that (easiest option that I know how to do atm)
to reset password check this out : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/resetting-permissions.html
if it errors make sure to use the defaults file thing as well

once set up make a database called car_rental

if it is done right you django server shouldnt make errors at u when u start it up
